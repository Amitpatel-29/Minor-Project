This Python script is designed to recommend movies based on a given input title. It uses text-based features such as the movie's overview, keywords, genres, cast, and director to calculate similarity scores between movies using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The script can handle partial title matching through `difflib.get_close_matches`, allowing the user to select the correct movie when there are multiple close matches.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

### Key Steps:
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Reads a dataset (`movies.csv`), fills missing values for key features (overview, keywords, genres, cast, director), and combines them into a single string called `combined_features`.

2. **Feature Vectorization**:
   - The `TfidfVectorizer` is used to convert the combined features into numerical feature vectors, which represent the text data for further processing.

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - The script calculates a cosine similarity matrix between all movies based on their feature vectors. This measures the similarity between movies.

4. **Recommendation Function**:
   - The function `get_recommendations` takes a movie title as input, finds close matches (with partial matching), prompts the user to choose the correct movie, and then recommends the top 10 most similar movies.

### How It Works:
1. You input a movie title.
2. The script suggests close matches based on partial title matching.
3. After you select the correct movie, it returns a list of recommended movies based on cosine similarity scores.

### To Use:
1. Ensure your dataset (`movies.csv`) contains at least the following columns:
   - `title`, `overview`, `keywords`, `genres`, `cast`, `director`
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn difflab
   ```

3. Run the script and input the movie title when prompted.

### Sample Output:
```
Enter a movie title for recommendations: Avengers

Did you mean one of these movies?
1. Avengers: Endgame
2. Avengers: Infinity War
3. The Avengers

Enter the number of the correct movie (1, 2, 3, etc.): 1

Based on the movie 'Avengers: Endgame', here are some recommended movies for you:

1. Avengers: Infinity War
2. Iron Man 3
3. Captain America: Civil War
...
```

This script will help you quickly find movies similar to the one you like, making it a simple recommendation system.
